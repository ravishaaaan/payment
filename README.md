# Setting Up PayHere Integration

To integrate PayHere into your project, follow these steps:

## 1. Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following line:

`PAYHERE_SECRET="replace with your payhere seacret"`


Replace **"replace with your payhere secret"** with your actual PayHere secret key.

## 2. Replace PayHere Merchant ID

In your code, locate the section where PayHere Merchant ID is mentioned. Replace it with your own PayHere Merchant ID.


Replace `"your_merchant_id_here"` with your actual PayHere Merchant ID.
